However, Johnson continued speaking for 36 minutes, turning verbal somersaults of every shade and hue of hypocrisy.

Corbin had obviously not taken the time to speak to the UNDP Deputy Country Director in Damascus. In August 2017 Akiko Suzaki told me (during an interview) that Syria did not need foreign interference, that its civil society was more than capable of repairing the damage done to its country and people by (internationally sponsored terrorism.)\n\nCorbin was simply protecting future \u201caid\u201d packages that would disguise UK FCO subversion tactics inside Syria. I will not dwell too much on the Panorama non-event. Corbin even managed to reduce the Nour Al Din Zenki torture, humiliation and public decapitation of 12 year old Palestinian child Abdullah Issa, down to \u201c(Zenki) beheaded a young prisoner\u201c.\n\nCorbin glossed over the fact that Issa begged to be shot rather than murdered in the brutal way that Zenki preferred. As is customary among colonial media reports, Corbin gave no name to this child, murdered by the terrorists that the BBC has promoted for 7 years, calling them \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d and \u201cdemocracy bringers\u201d.

She did not explain the connections between the Free Syrian Police, the White Helmets and the Local Councils as exposed in my article:\n\nWhite Helmets and Local Councils \u2013 Is the UK FCO Financing Terrorism in Syria with Taxpayer Funds?\n\nCorbin announced that the Free Syrian Police cannot operate separately to Nusra Front or other terrorist groups occupying specific areas inside Syria. This applies across the board, Corbin, it includes the White Helmets, the Local Councils, the UK FCO created and funded media groups \u2013 all those who work within these terrorist-held areas, work exclusively for their sponsors in the 74 member war coalition and support their geopolitical aims in the region.\n\nWhy did Corbin not mention them? Simply because the Free Syrian Police will be re-integrated into the myriad of other \u201cFree\u201d organisations.

The \u2018Global Britain\u2019 \u201caid-for-Syria\u201d edifice had been crumbling around its rotten foundations, for some time. During the seven year war that has been waged against Syria, colonial media has been consistently exposed as the corroded-from-within spectre of journalism it really is. They are a denuded gaggle of UK/US State script writers who have lost credibility among their public sponsors whom they have deceived and taken for fools, for way too long. Now, they are being dragged to account and they are not happy.\n\nHowever a few points were made during the programme that should be capitalised upon. Nick Dearden of Global Justice Now made the following statement:\n\n\u201c(The UK Government) simply cannot operate aid projects like that with so little scrutiny or accountability\u201d\n\nAnyone who has experienced the lack of \u201cfreedom\u201d in the UK FCO responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, will smile ruefully at this statement. The dismay expressed by Dearden after seven years of Global Britain\u2019s obfuscation and double-speak regarding their faux humanitarian role in Syria is too little too late.\n\nI was sent the following two FOI requests very recently. They perfectly demonstrate the denial of freedom of information by Global Britain. They should also raise further questions as to the accountability for taxpayer funds \u2013 who and what are they financing? Who is conducting the \u201cvetting procedures\u201d and how can they be considered viable when terrorism flourishes in Syria, in areas where UK and US AID sustains them, while the Syrian people continue to die, starve and suffer under occupation by British \u2018financed-by-mistake\u2019, terrorist groups.\n\nWhy should we trust a government that bases its policy statements upon spurious evidence provided by terrorist embeds & \u201cunvetted\u201d individuals working under the control of extremist groups secretly benefitting from UK AID?\n\nFor example, on the 12th July 2017, Mathew Rycroft, then-permanent UK representative to the UN, made the following statement on \u201cthis sickening use of chemical weapons \u2013 weapons that Assad agreed in 2013, to destroy \u2013 is just the latest in a long list of abhorrent acts\u201d. Employing the now familiar, sociopathically unbalanced, \u2018language of diplomacy\u2019 that is representative of Global Britain\u2019s foreign policy, Rycroft made the definitive claim:\n\n\u201cChemical weapons scientists at Porton Down, in the United Kingdom, have analysed samples obtained from Khan Shaykun, and these have tested positive for the nerve agent sarin, or a sarin-like substance. The United Kingdom therefore shares the US assessment that it is highly likely that the regime was responsible for a sarin attack on Khan Shaykun on the 4th of April.\u201d\n\nThis statement carries with it, the potential to escalate military conflict in the region to catastrophic levels, so it is logical, even rational to presume that the UK FCO would have access to the report from Porton Down that has been cited by its representative at the UN. Think again:\n\nThe UK FCO \u201ccan neither confirm nor deny that the information (Porton Down report) requested is held by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u201d. So, yet again, Global Britain demonstrates its duplicity and deceit \u2013 it is not interested in \u201caid\u201d for the Syrian people, it is interested in maintaining pressure upon a recalcitrant state that has confounded the might of 74 coalition member states intent upon its destruction.\n\nAt the end of the Panorama report we are told:\n\n\u201cThe money of British tax payers is being spent very poorly, it is unfortunately strengthening the extremists and Islamic groups, currently in control of the majority of \u201copposition\u201d areas\u201d\n\nWell, bravo BBC for finally stating the blindingly obvious. Thank you, however, for giving us the slap-down to all those \u201cKremlin agent\u201d finger pointers in the ranks of colonial media, the braying media lynch mob who have demonised all under-funded independent media & analysts who have said exactly this, throughout the Global Britain interventionist project in Syria and the region.\n\nThank you BBC for limping across the finishing line with your broken baton of half truths \u2013 finally, through gritted teeth, you serve us well.\n\nThe Conflict Stability and Security Fund in Detail\n\nI was recently sent the full breakdown of the Conflict Stability and Security Fund which had been detailed following a request from a member of the House of Lords. (Names withheld)\n\n1. Political Support \u2013 \u00a3 14 million\n\n2. Peace Building and Track II \u2013 \u00a3 18 million\n\n3. Civilian-Military Integration and support to \u201cModerate\u201d Armed Groups \u2013 \u00a3 32 million\n\n4. Safety, Security, Stability \u2013 \u00a3 54 million\n\n5. Governance, Livelihood and Education \u2013 \u00a3 39 million\n\n6. Strategic Communications \u2013 \u00a3 23 million\n\n7. Human Rights and Accountability \u2013 \u00a3 20 million\n\nThe UK FCO has effectively spent \u00a3 200 million of taxpayer contributions on a 7-year-long, failed military campaign in Syria. Boris Johnson\u2019s posturing and self-congratulatory celebration of a victory against terrorism should ring hollow for those who are living beneath the poverty line in \u201cAusterity\u201d plagued Global Britain as their undisclosed contributions to the Global war fund, have ensured the devastation of yet another sovereign nation.\n\nThe British government has lied to its citizens time and time again. Fantasy \u201cWMDs\u201d took us to war in Iraq. False claims of viagra-fuelled rape by Gadaffi\u2019s soldiers in Benghazi led to the Libyan failed state, bombed into oblivion by the NATO intervention. Syria is no exception to the rule of wars based upon deceit, facilitated by the corporate media and think tank accomplices who support the criminal Global Britain operations with their own thinly disguised form of media terrorism.\n\nSyria does not need \u201cpolitical support\u201d, it has a majority elected government and is perfectly capable of negotiating its own political reforms without hostile foreign meddling. Syria does not need \u201cpeace building\u201d from Global Britain, it would like GB to lift the sanctions that are collectively punishing the Syrian people while impeding resolution and political, economic progress inside Syria. Syria would like GB to stop financing the terrorist groups that are torturing, raping, executing, starving and imprisoning the Syrian people.\n\nHow does GB vet the \u201cmoderate\u201d armed groups? How does GB justify fomenting an insurgency against a sovereign state under international law? How do they verify that the aid is \u201cnon lethal\u201d when even BBC Panorama has reported on the \u201cbags of cash\u201d being handled by the extremist groups courtesy of Global Britain\u2019s aid contractors.\n\n\u201cInternational law is indifferent to the perceived legitimacy of the state and to the form of government; both democracies and authoritarian regimes have the right to fight insurgencies and to defend themselves from external powers which aid the insurgents. Either way, it falls under the domestic jurisdiction of the state. Foreign powers are prohibited from assisting insurgents. General Assembly resolution 2131 (XX) declares that \u201cno State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State.\u201d This was reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua v. USA. The injured state is even entitled to adopt countermeasures against the intervening state.\u201d ~ Amal Saad.\n\nSyria was \u201csafe, secure and stable\u201d before Global Britain started its programme of introducing \u201csafety, stability and security\u201d to the region. How does the UK FCO verify the 100,000 civilians that the multi-million-funded White Helmets claim to have \u201csaved\u201d. What documentation exists? What inventory of names, dates, after-care, exists that can prove this wild assertion by an organisation known to work exclusively with Nusra Front (Al Qaeda) and associates just as the criminalised Free Syrian Police do, according to BBC Panorama.\n\nHow can the White Helmets serve 7 million Syrians when over 80% of the civilian population is serviced by the REAL Syria Civil Defence which has been in existence since 1953. Why is that volunteer, Syrian humanitarian organisation helping real Syrians, being targeted by economic sanctions while the White Helmets receive UKAID and equipment as \u201cNusra Front\u2019s civil defence\u201d or \u201cIslamic State\u2019s fire brigade\u201d?\n\n\n\nJohn Cantile ((kidnapped by ISIS for last 5 years) filming in East Aleppo.\n\nGlobal Britain claims to provide health and education to the beleaguered Syrian people who had free healthcare and education, a social system which was the envy of the Middle East \u2013 long before GB intervened and brought this system to its knees through economic and military terrorism. Meanwhile, back home, GB is steadily destroying the NHS and the UK education system.\n\nFinally, GB has waged information warfare against Syria with \u00a3 43 million of taxpayer funds \u2013 establishing, training and equipping anti-Syrian-state media cells in Gaziantep, a city in Turkey, known as the Jihadi Express. Media cells who have provided much of the war fiction that has fed the pseudo humanitarian complex, chafing at the bit to infiltrate Syria with its toxic aid packages.\n\n\u00a3 200 million has financed the maintenance of \u201cConflict\u201d, it has guaranteed instability and inscecurity for the Syrian people and we have paid for this entire criminal project, not just the select \u201cJihadists\u201d that BBC Panorama decided to offer as a sacrificial lamb on the altar of Global Britain\u2019s intelligence operations inside Syria.\n\nIn his letter to PM Theresa May, Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn said:\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of your government to ensure robust scrutiny and transparency processes are in place to prevent such grotesque abuses of UK aid money.\n\n\u201cGiven the humanitarian crisis in Syria, with millions of Syrians internally displaced and millions of Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries, it is a real concern that your government has appeared to use aid funding to support sectarian division rather than humanitarian need.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Morning Star report, \u201cThe government has suspended the billion-pound Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF)\u201d.\n\nGlobal Britian hides its neocolonialist ventures behind the barricade of \u201caid\u201d contractors that provide \u201cplausible deniability\u201d when evidence of UK villainy reaches unmanageable proportions.\n\nThe UK taxpayers must demand answers from Global Britain and the UK Government. Boris Johnson must not be allowed to celebrate a victory that is not his. The Syrian Arab Army and allies have defeated international terrorism in Syria against all the odds and under punishing conditions which have been financed and fomented by the 74 members of the war coalition.\n\nGlobal Britain has financed terrorism and bloodshed in Syria, nothing less, and it must be held accountable so history will not endlessly repeat itself at the cost of innocent people in target nations who are perfectly capable of resolving their internal issues without the international, pseudo-humanitarian-aid pretexts fanning the flames of manufactured \u2018dissent\u2019, which inevitably lead to the hybrid wars we are witnessing on a horrifying and ever-expanding global scale.\n\n***\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE WHITE HELMETS BY READING THE FOLLOWING ARTICLES:\n\nEvidence: UK Foreign Office Funding Terrorists in Syria:\n\nWhite Helmets & \u2018Local Councils\u2019 \u2013 Is UK FCO Financing Terrorism in Syria?\n\nVanessa Beeley:\n\nWHITE HELMETS: State Sanctioned Terrorism and Hollywood Poster Boys for War\n\n21st Century Wire:\n\nNew Report Destroys Fabricated Myth of Syria\u2019s \u2018White Helmets\u2019\n\nInitial Investigation into White Helmets:\n\nWho are Syria\u2019s White Helmets?\n\n21st Century Wire article on the White Helmets:\n\nSyria\u2019s White Helmets: War by Way of Deception ~ the \u201cModerate\u201d Executioners\n\nWho Funds the White Helmets?\n\nSecret \u00a31bn UK War Chest Used to Fund the White Helmets and Other \u2018Initiatives\u2019\n\nOriginal investigative report:\n\nThe REAL Syria Civil Defence Exposes Fake White Helmets as Terrorist-Linked Imposters\n\nIrish Peace Prize Farce\n\nTipperary\u2019s White Helmets Peace Prize: A Judas Kiss to the Antiwar Movement and Syria\n\nWhite Helmets Executions\n\nWHITE HELMETS: Severed Heads of Syrian Arab Army Soldiers Paraded as Trophies\n\nCNN Fabricate News About the White Helmets\n\nA NOBEL LIE: CNN\u2019s Claim That \u2018White Helmets Center in Damascus\u2019 Was Hit by a Barrel Bomb\n\nWhite Helmets Links to Al Nusra\n\nWHITE HELMETS: Hand in Hand with Al Qaeda and Extremist Child Beheaders in Aleppo\n\nReport by Patrick Henningsen\n\nAN INTRODUCTION: Smart Power & The Human Rights Industrial Complex\n\nOpen Letter by Vanessa Beeley\n\nWhite Helmets Campaign for War NOT Peace \u2013 Retract RLA & Nobel Peace Prize Nominations\n\nStaged Rescue Videos\n\n(VIDEO) White Helmets: Miraculous \u2018Rag Doll Rescue\u2019\n\nWhite Helmets Oscar Award Farce:\n\nForget Oscar: Give The White Helmets the Leni Riefenstahl Award for Best War Propaganda Film\n\nCory Morningstar report:\n\nInvestigation into the funding sources of the White Helmets, including Avaaz, Purpose, The Syria Campaign\n\nOpen letter to Canadian MPs from Stop the War Hamilton (Canada):\n\nLetter from the Hamilton Coalition to Stop War to the New Democratic Party in Canada ref the White Helmet nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize:\n\nOpen letter to Canada\u2019s NDP Leader on Nobel Prize:\n\nLetter to NDP from Prof. John Ryan protesting White Helmet nomination for RLA and Nobel Peace Prize\n\nREAD MORE WHITE HELMETS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire White Helmets Files\n\nREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files\n\nSUPPORT 21WIRE \u2013 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV", "post_tags": "BBC", "post_categories": "Patrick Henningsen LIVE", "post_length": 20147, "num_outlinks": 153, "sentiment_score": 0.01592520027864856, "post_lang": "en", "influence_score": -45.9, "data_quality": 1.0}

The dismay expressed by Dearden after seven years of Global Britain\u2019s obfuscation and double-speak regarding their faux humanitarian role in Syria is too little too late.\n\nI was sent the following two FOI requests very recently. They perfectly demonstrate the denial of freedom of information by Global Britain. They should also raise further questions as to the accountability for taxpayer funds \u2013 who and what are they financing? Who is conducting the \u201cvetting procedures\u201d and how can they be considered viable when terrorism flourishes in Syria, in areas where UK and US AID sustains them, while the Syrian people continue to die, starve and suffer under occupation by British \u2018financed-by-mistake\u2019, terrorist groups.\n\nWhy should we trust a government that bases its policy statements upon spurious evidence provided by terrorist embeds & \u201cunvetted\u201d individuals working under the control of extremist groups secretly benefitting from UK AID?\n\nFor example, on the 12th July 2017, Mathew Rycroft, then-permanent UK representative to the UN, made the following statement on \u201cthis sickening use of chemical weapons \u2013 weapons that Assad agreed in 2013, to destroy \u2013 is just the latest in a long list of abhorrent acts\u201d. Employing the now familiar, sociopathically unbalanced, \u2018language of diplomacy\u2019 that is representative of Global Britain\u2019s foreign policy, Rycroft made the definitive claim:\n\n\u201cChemical weapons scientists at Porton Down, in the United Kingdom, have analysed samples obtained from Khan Shaykun, and these have tested positive for the nerve agent sarin, or a sarin-like substance. The United Kingdom therefore shares the US assessment that it is highly likely that the regime was responsible for a sarin attack on Khan Shaykun on the 4th of April.\u201d\n\nThis statement carries with it, the potential to escalate military conflict in the region to catastrophic levels, so it is logical, even rational to presume that the UK FCO would have access to the report from Porton Down that has been cited by its representative at the UN. Think again:\n\nThe UK FCO \u201ccan neither confirm nor deny that the information (Porton Down report) requested is held by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u201d. So, yet again, Global Britain demonstrates its duplicity and deceit \u2013 it is not interested in \u201caid\u201d for the Syrian people, it is interested in maintaining pressure upon a recalcitrant state that has confounded the might of 74 coalition member states intent upon its destruction.\n\nAt the end of the Panorama report we are told:\n\n\u201cThe money of British tax payers is being spent very poorly, it is unfortunately strengthening the extremists and Islamic groups, currently in control of the majority of \u201copposition\u201d areas\u201d\n\nWell, bravo BBC for finally stating the blindingly obvious. Thank you, however, for giving us the slap-down to all those \u201cKremlin agent\u201d finger pointers in the ranks of colonial media, the braying media lynch mob who have demonised all under-funded independent media & analysts who have said exactly this, throughout the Global Britain interventionist project in Syria and the region.\n\nThank you BBC for limping across the finishing line with your broken baton of half truths \u2013 finally, through gritted teeth, you serve us well.\n\nThe Conflict Stability and Security Fund in Detail\n\nI was recently sent the full breakdown of the Conflict Stability and Security Fund which had been detailed following a request from a member of the House of Lords. (Names withheld)\n\n1. Political Support \u2013 \u00a3 14 million\n\n2. Peace Building and Track II \u2013 \u00a3 18 million\n\n3. Civilian-Military Integration and support to \u201cModerate\u201d Armed Groups \u2013 \u00a3 32 million\n\n4. Safety, Security, Stability \u2013 \u00a3 54 million\n\n5. Governance, Livelihood and Education \u2013 \u00a3 39 million\n\n6. Strategic Communications \u2013 \u00a3 23 million\n\n7. Human Rights and Accountability \u2013 \u00a3 20 million\n\nThe UK FCO has effectively spent \u00a3 200 million of taxpayer contributions on a 7-year-long, failed military campaign in Syria. Boris Johnson\u2019s posturing and self-congratulatory celebration of a victory against terrorism should ring hollow for those who are living beneath the poverty line in \u201cAusterity\u201d plagued Global Britain as their undisclosed contributions to the Global war fund, have ensured the devastation of yet another sovereign nation.\n\nThe British government has lied to its citizens time and time again. Fantasy \u201cWMDs\u201d took us to war in Iraq. False claims of viagra-fuelled rape by Gadaffi\u2019s soldiers in Benghazi led to the Libyan failed state, bombed into oblivion by the NATO intervention. Syria is no exception to the rule of wars based upon deceit, facilitated by the corporate media and think tank accomplices who support the criminal Global Britain operations with their own thinly disguised form of media terrorism.\n\nSyria does not need \u201cpolitical support\u201d, it has a majority elected government and is perfectly capable of negotiating its own political reforms without hostile foreign meddling. Syria does not need \u201cpeace building\u201d from Global Britain, it would like GB to lift the sanctions that are collectively punishing the Syrian people while impeding resolution and political, economic progress inside Syria. Syria would like GB to stop financing the terrorist groups that are torturing, raping, executing, starving and imprisoning the Syrian people.\n\nHow does GB vet the \u201cmoderate\u201d armed groups? How does GB justify fomenting an insurgency against a sovereign state under international law? How do they verify that the aid is \u201cnon lethal\u201d when even BBC Panorama has reported on the \u201cbags of cash\u201d being handled by the extremist groups courtesy of Global Britain\u2019s aid contractors.\n\n\u201cInternational law is indifferent to the perceived legitimacy of the state and to the form of government; both democracies and authoritarian regimes have the right to fight insurgencies and to defend themselves from external powers which aid the insurgents. Either way, it falls under the domestic jurisdiction of the state. Foreign powers are prohibited from assisting insurgents. General Assembly resolution 2131 (XX) declares that \u201cno State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State.\u201d This was reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua v. USA. The injured state is even entitled to adopt countermeasures against the intervening state.\u201d ~ Amal Saad.\n\nSyria was \u201csafe, secure and stable\u201d before Global Britain started its programme of introducing \u201csafety, stability and security\u201d to the region. How does the UK FCO verify the 100,000 civilians that the multi-million-funded White Helmets claim to have \u201csaved\u201d. What documentation exists? What inventory of names, dates, after-care, exists that can prove this wild assertion by an organisation known to work exclusively with Nusra Front (Al Qaeda) and associates just as the criminalised Free Syrian Police do, according to BBC Panorama.\n\nHow can the White Helmets serve 7 million Syrians when over 80% of the civilian population is serviced by the REAL Syria Civil Defence which has been in existence since 1953. Why is that volunteer, Syrian humanitarian organisation helping real Syrians, being targeted by economic sanctions while the White Helmets receive UKAID and equipment as \u201cNusra Front\u2019s civil defence\u201d or \u201cIslamic State\u2019s fire brigade\u201d?\n\n\n\nJohn Cantile ((kidnapped by ISIS for last 5 years) filming in East Aleppo.\n\nGlobal Britain claims to provide health and education to the beleaguered Syrian people who had free healthcare and education, a social system which was the envy of the Middle East \u2013 long before GB intervened and brought this system to its knees through economic and military terrorism. Meanwhile, back home, GB is steadily destroying the NHS and the UK education system.\n\nFinally, GB has waged information warfare against Syria with \u00a3 43 million of taxpayer funds \u2013 establishing, training and equipping anti-Syrian-state media cells in Gaziantep, a city in Turkey, known as the Jihadi Express. Media cells who have provided much of the war fiction that has fed the pseudo humanitarian complex, chafing at the bit to infiltrate Syria with its toxic aid packages.\n\n\u00a3 200 million has financed the maintenance of \u201cConflict\u201d, it has guaranteed instability and inscecurity for the Syrian people and we have paid for this entire criminal project, not just the select \u201cJihadists\u201d that BBC Panorama decided to offer as a sacrificial lamb on the altar of Global Britain\u2019s intelligence operations inside Syria.\n\nIn his letter to PM Theresa May, Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn said:\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of your government to ensure robust scrutiny and transparency processes are in place to prevent such grotesque abuses of UK aid money.\n\n\u201cGiven the humanitarian crisis in Syria, with millions of Syrians internally displaced and millions of Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries, it is a real concern that your government has appeared to use aid funding to support sectarian division rather than humanitarian need.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Morning Star report, \u201cThe government has suspended the billion-pound Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF)\u201d.\n\nGlobal Britian hides its neocolonialist ventures behind the barricade of \u201caid\u201d contractors that provide \u201cplausible deniability\u201d when evidence of UK villainy reaches unmanageable proportions.\n\nThe UK taxpayers must demand answers from Global Britain and the UK Government. Boris Johnson must not be allowed to celebrate a victory that is not his. The Syrian Arab Army and allies have defeated international terrorism in Syria against all the odds and under punishing conditions which have been financed and fomented by the 74 members of the war coalition.\n\nGlobal Britain has financed terrorism and bloodshed in Syria, nothing less, and it must be held accountable so history will not endlessly repeat itself at the cost of innocent people in target nations who are perfectly capable of resolving their internal issues without the international, pseudo-humanitarian-aid pretexts fanning the flames of manufactured \u2018dissent\u2019, which inevitably lead to the hybrid wars we are witnessing on a horrifying and ever-expanding global scale.\n\n***\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE WHITE HELMETS BY READING THE FOLLOWING ARTICLES:\n\nEvidence: UK Foreign Office Funding Terrorists in Syria:\n\nWhite Helmets & \u2018Local Councils\u2019 \u2013 Is UK FCO Financing Terrorism in Syria?\n\nVanessa Beeley:\n\nWHITE HELMETS: State Sanctioned Terrorism and Hollywood Poster Boys for War\n\n21st Century Wire:\n\nNew Report Destroys Fabricated Myth of Syria\u2019s \u2018White Helmets\u2019\n\nInitial Investigation into White Helmets:\n\nWho are Syria\u2019s White Helmets?\n\n21st Century Wire article on the White Helmets:\n\nSyria\u2019s White Helmets: War by Way of Deception ~ the \u201cModerate\u201d Executioners\n\nWho Funds the White Helmets?\n\nSecret \u00a31bn UK War Chest Used to Fund the White Helmets and Other \u2018Initiatives\u2019\n\nOriginal investigative report:\n\nThe REAL Syria Civil Defence Exposes Fake White Helmets as Terrorist-Linked Imposters\n\nIrish Peace Prize Farce\n\nTipperary\u2019s White Helmets Peace Prize: A Judas Kiss to the Antiwar Movement and Syria\n\nWhite Helmets Executions\n\nWHITE HELMETS: Severed Heads of Syrian Arab Army Soldiers Paraded as Trophies\n\nCNN Fabricate News About the White Helmets\n\nA NOBEL LIE: CNN\u2019s Claim That \u2018White Helmets Center in Damascus\u2019 Was Hit by a Barrel Bomb\n\nWhite Helmets Links to Al Nusra\n\nWHITE HELMETS: Hand in Hand with Al Qaeda and Extremist Child Beheaders in Aleppo\n\nReport by Patrick Henningsen\n\nAN INTRODUCTION: Smart Power & The Human Rights Industrial Complex\n\nOpen Letter by Vanessa Beeley\n\nWhite Helmets Campaign for War NOT Peace \u2013 Retract RLA & Nobel Peace Prize Nominations\n\nStaged Rescue Videos\n\n(VIDEO) White Helmets: Miraculous \u2018Rag Doll Rescue\u2019\n\nWhite Helmets Oscar Award Farce:\n\nForget Oscar: Give The White Helmets the Leni Riefenstahl Award for Best War Propaganda Film\n\nCory Morningstar report:\n\nInvestigation into the funding sources of the White Helmets, including Avaaz, Purpose, The Syria Campaign\n\nOpen letter to Canadian MPs from Stop the War Hamilton (Canada):\n\nLetter from the Hamilton Coalition to Stop War to the New Democratic Party in Canada ref the White Helmet nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize:\n\nOpen letter to Canada\u2019s NDP Leader on Nobel Prize:\n\nLetter to NDP from Prof. John Ryan protesting White Helmet nomination for RLA and Nobel Peace Prize\n\nREAD MORE WHITE HELMETS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire White Helmets Files\n\nREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files\n\nSUPPORT 21WIRE \u2013 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV", "post_tags": "BBC", "post_categories": "Patrick Henningsen LIVE", "post_length": 20147, "num_outlinks": 153, "sentiment_score": 0.01592520027864856, "post_lang": "en", "influence_score": -45.9, "data_quality": 1.0}
